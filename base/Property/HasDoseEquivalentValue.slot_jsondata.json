            "text": "\"Dose Equivalent\" (former), or $\\textit{Equivalent Absorbed Radiation Dose}$, usually shortened to $\\textit{Equivalent Dose}$, is a computed average measure of the radiation absorbed by a fixed mass of biological tissue, that attempts to account for the different biological damage potential of different types of ionizing radiation. The equivalent dose to a tissue is found by multiplying the absorbed dose, in gray, by a dimensionless \"quality factor\" $Q$, dependent upon radiation type, and by another dimensionless factor $N$, dependent on all other pertinent factors. N depends upon the part of the body irradiated, the time and volume over which the dose was spread, even the species of the subject.",
