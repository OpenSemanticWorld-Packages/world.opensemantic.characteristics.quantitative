In general, the more uncertain or random the event is, the more information it will contain. The concept of information entropy was created by a mathematician. He was named Claude Elwood Shannon. It has applications in many areas, including lossless data compression, statistical inference, cryptography and recently in other disciplines as biology, physics or machine learning.",
