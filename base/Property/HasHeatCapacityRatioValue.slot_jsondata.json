For an ideal gas, the heat capacity is constant with temperature ($\\theta$). Accordingly we can express the enthalpy as $H = C_P*\\theta$ and the internal energy as $U = C_V \\cdot \\theta$. Thus, it can also be said that the heat capacity ratio is the ratio between enthalpy and internal energy.",
