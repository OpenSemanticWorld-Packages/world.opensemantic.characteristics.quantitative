The concepts of work and energy are closely tied to the concept of force because an applied force can do work on an object and cause a change in energy. Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Work is done on an object when an applied force moves it through a distance. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object in motion. The net work is equal to the change in kinetic energy.",
