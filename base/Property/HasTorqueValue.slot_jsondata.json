            "text": "In physics, a torque ($\\tau$) is a vector that measures the tendency of a force to rotate an object about some axis. The magnitude of a torque is defined as force times its lever arm. Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist. The SI unit for torque is newton meters ($N m$). In U.S. customary units, it is measured in foot pounds (ft lbf) (also known as \"pounds feet\").\nMathematically, the torque on a particle (which has the position r in some reference frame) can be defined as the cross product: $τ = r x F$\nwhere,\nr is the particle's position vector relative to the fulcrum\nF is the force acting on the particles,\nor, more generally, torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum: $τ = dL/dt$\nwhere,\nL is the angular momentum vector\nt stands for time.",
