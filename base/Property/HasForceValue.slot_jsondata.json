            "text": "\"Force\" is an influence that causes mass to accelerate. It may be experienced as a lift, a push, or a pull. Force is defined by Newton's Second Law as $F = m \\times a $, where $F$ is force, $m$ is mass and $a$ is acceleration. Net force is mathematically equal to the time rate of change of the momentum of the body on which it acts. Since momentum is a vector quantity (has both a magnitude and direction), force also is a vector quantity.",
