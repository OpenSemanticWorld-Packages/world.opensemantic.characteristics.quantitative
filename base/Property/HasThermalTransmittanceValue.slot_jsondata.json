The thermal transmittance of a material (such as insulation or concrete) or an assembly (such as a wall or window) is expressed as a U-value. The concept of thermal transmittance is closely related to that of thermal resistance. The thermal resistance of a structure is the reciprocal of its thermal transmittance.",
