            "text": "In a dielectric material the presence of an electric field E causes the bound charges in the material (atomic nuclei and their electrons) to slightly separate, inducing a local electric dipole moment. The Electric Displacement Field, $D$, is a vector field that accounts for the effects of free charges within such dielectric materials. This describes also the charge density on an extended surface that could be causing the field.",
