The electric and magnetic fields are two interrelated aspects of a single object, called the electromagnetic field. A pure electric field in one reference frame is observed as a combination of both an electric field and a magnetic field in a moving reference frame. The Auxillary Magnetic Field, H characterizes how the true Magnetic Field B influences the organization of magnetic dipoles in a given medium.",
