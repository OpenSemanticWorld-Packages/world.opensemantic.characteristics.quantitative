The amount of electric current through some surface, for example, a section through a copper conductor, is defined as the amount of electric charge flowing through that surface over time. Current is a scalar-valued quantity. Electric current is one of the base quantities in the International System of Quantities, ISQ, on which the International System of Units, SI, is based.",
