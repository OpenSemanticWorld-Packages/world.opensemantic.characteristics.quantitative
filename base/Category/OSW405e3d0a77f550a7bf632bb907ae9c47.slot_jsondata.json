In thermodynamics, $\\textit{enthalpy}$ is the sum of the internal energy U and the product of pressure p and volume V of a system: $H = U + pV$.  The internal energy U and the work term pV have dimension of energy, in SI units this is joule; the extensive (linear in size) quantity H has the same dimension.",
