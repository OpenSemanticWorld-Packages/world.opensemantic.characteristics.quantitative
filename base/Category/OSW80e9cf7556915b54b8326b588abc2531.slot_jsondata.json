            "text": "\"Permeance\" is the inverse of reluctance. Permeance is a measure of the quantity of flux for a number of current-turns in magnetic circuit. A magnetic circuit almost acts as though the flux is \"conducted\", therefore permeance is larger for large cross sections of a material and smaller for longer lengths. This concept is analogous to electrical conductance in the electric circuit.",
