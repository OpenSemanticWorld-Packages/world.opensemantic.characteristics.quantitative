            "text": "\"Electric Charge\" is a fundamental conserved property of some subatomic particles, which determines their electromagnetic interaction. Electrically charged matter is influenced by, and produces, electromagnetic fields. The electric charge on a body may be positive or negative. Two positively charged bodies experience a mutual repulsive force, as do two negatively charged bodies. A positively charged body and a negatively charged body experience an attractive force. Electric charge is carried by discrete particles and can be positive or negative. The sign convention is such that the elementary electric charge $e$, that is, the charge of the proton, is positive. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb.",
