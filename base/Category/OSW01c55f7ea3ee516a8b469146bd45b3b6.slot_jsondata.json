            "text": "\"Electric Current Phasor\" is a representation of current as a sinusoidal integral quantity using a complex quantity whose argument is equal to the initial phase and whose modulus is equal to the root-mean-square value. A phasor is a constant complex number, usually expressed in exponential form, representing the complex amplitude (magnitude and phase) of a sinusoidal function of time. Phasors are used by electrical engineers to simplify computations involving sinusoids, where they can often reduce a differential equation problem to an algebraic one.",
