The potential used depends on the constraints of the system, such as constant temperature or pressure. $\\textit{Internal Energy} is the internal energy of the system, Enthalpy is the internal energy of the system plus the energy related to pressure-volume work, and Helmholtz and Gibbs free energy are the energies available in a system to do useful work when the temperature and volume or the pressure and temperature are fixed, respectively. The name Gibbs Free Energy is also used.",
