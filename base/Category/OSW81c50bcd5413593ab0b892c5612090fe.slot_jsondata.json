            "text": "The mass-to-charge ratio ratio ($m/Q$) is a physical quantity that is widely used in the electrodynamics of charged particles, for example, in electron optics and ion optics. The importance of the mass-to-charge ratio, according to classical electrodynamics, is that two particles with the same mass-to-charge ratio move in the same path in a vacuum when subjected to the same electric and magnetic fields. Its SI units are $kg/C$, but it can also be measured in Thomson ($Th$).",
