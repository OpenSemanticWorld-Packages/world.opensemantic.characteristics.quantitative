As the reacting molecules (or moieties) consist of a definite set of atoms in an integer ratio, the ratio between reactants in a complete reaction is also in integer ratio. A reaction may consume more than one molecule, and the \"Stoichiometric Number\" counts this number, defined as positive for products (added) and negative for reactants (removed).",
