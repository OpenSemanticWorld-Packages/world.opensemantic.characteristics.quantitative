            "text": "When the temperature of a substance changes, the energy that is stored in the intermolecular bonds between atoms changes. When the stored energy increases, so does the length of the molecular bonds. As a result, solids typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed by its coefficient of thermal expansion. Different coefficients of thermal expansion can be defined for a substance depending on whether the expansion is measured by: linear thermal expansion, area thermal expansion, or volumetric thermal expansion.",
