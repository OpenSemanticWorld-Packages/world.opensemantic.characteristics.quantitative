            "text": "In thermodynamics, $\\textit{enthalpy}$ is the sum of the internal energy $U$ and the product of pressure $p$ and volume $V$ of a system. The characteristic function (also known as thermodynamic potential) $\\textit{enthalpy}$ used to be called $\\textit{heat content}$, which is why it is conventionally indicated by $H$. The specific enthalpy of a working mass is a property of that mass used in thermodynamics, defined as $h=u+p \\cdot v$,  where $u$ is the specific internal energy, $p$ is the pressure, and $v$ is specific volume. In other words, $h = H / m$ where $m$ is the mass of the system. The SI unit for $\\textit{Specific Enthalpy}$ is $\\textit{joules per kilogram}$",
