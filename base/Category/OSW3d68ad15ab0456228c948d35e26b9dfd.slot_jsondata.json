            "text": "$\\textit{Kinetic Energy}$ is the energy which a body possesses as a consequence of its motion, defined as one-half the product of its mass $m$ and the square of its speed $v$, $ \\frac{1}{2} mv^{2} $. The kinetic energy per unit volume of a fluid parcel is the $ \\frac{1}{2}  p v^{2}$ , where $p$ is the density and $v$ the speed of the parcel. See potential energy. For relativistic speeds the kinetic energy is given by $E_k = mc^2 - m_0 c^2$, where $c$ is the velocity of light in a vacuum, $m_0$ is the rest mass, and $m$ is the moving mass.",
