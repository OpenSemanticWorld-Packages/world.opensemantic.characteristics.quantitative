            "text": "$\\textit{Acceleration}$ is the (instantaneous) rate of change of velocity. \n  Acceleration may be either linear acceleration, or angular acceleration. \n  It is a vector quantity with dimension $length/time^{2}$ for linear acceleration,\n   or in the case of angular acceleration, with dimension $angle/time^{2}$. \n  $$$$\n  In SI units, linear acceleration is measured in $meters/second^{2}$ ($m \\cdot s^{-2}$),\n   and angular acceleration is measured in $radians/second^{2}$. \n  $$$$\n  In physics, any increase or decrease in speed is referred to as acceleration and similarly,\n   motion in a circle at constant speed is also an acceleration, since the direction component of the velocity is changing.",
